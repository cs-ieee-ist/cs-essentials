When we execute the file the shell will run the commands specified in the file which allows us to automate a lot of tasks, simple or complex. Over the years many shells have been developed, like Bourne shell (sh), Bourne Again shell\n(bash), Korn shell (ksh), and C shell (csh) each with its own scripting language.  The shell we are going to use is the Bourne Again shell or Bash.</p>\n<h2>Basic Script file</h2>\n<p>Create a file named <code>hello.sh</code> (the .sh extension is just convention and therefore optional), in this example, we are going to use Vim but you can the text editor you like.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">$ </span><span class=\"bash\">vim hello.sh</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Copy the following text to your new file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-bash\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">#!/bin/bash</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">echo</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Hello World\"</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first line of the file is a very important one because it will tell the shell what program it should use to interpret the script. In this case, it will use bash, located at <code>/bin/bash</code>.</p>\n<p>The last line will run the <code>echo</code> command which will print <code>Hello World</code> in the terminal.</p>\n<p><strong>Run script</strong></p>\n<p>To run the script we need to give ourselves permission to execute the file. To do that we have to run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">$ </span><span class=\"bash\"><span class=\"hljs-built_in\">chmod</span> +x hello.sh</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can run the script:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">./hello.sh\nHello World\n</code></pre>"},"topicPages":[{"topic":"Shell Script","page":"Introduction"},{"topic":"Shell Script","page":"Variables"},{"topic":"Shell Script","page":"Loops And Ifs"},{"topic":"Shell Script","page":"Functions"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
