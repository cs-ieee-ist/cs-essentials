This means that more than one user can use the same computer at the same time. To protect the users from each was created a permission method to only allow certain users to read, write or execute a certain file.</p>\n<h2>File Permissions</h2>\n<p>On Linux, each file and directory has assigned access rights. These rights are categorized into three groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The file owner</li>\n<li>Users in the owner's group</li>\n<li>Others Users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And each group has the same three privilege definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>read (r)</li>\n<li>write (w)</li>\n<li>execute (x)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To see the permissions assigned to a file we can use the ls command with the -l flag. Example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">$ </span><span class=\"bash\"><span class=\"hljs-built_in\">ls</span> -l /bin/bash</span>\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1183448 Feb 25 12:03 /bin/bash\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output follows this pattern:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1183448 Feb 25 12:03 /bin/bash\n^+-+   +-+ ^   ^    ^     ^    +----------+ +-------+\n| | +-+ |  |   |    |     |         |           |\n| |  |  |  |   |    |     |         |           File name\n| |  |  |  |   |    |     |         Modification Date\n| |  |  |  |   |    |     File Size\n| |  |  |  |   |    Owner group\n| |  |  |  |   User owner\n| |  |  |  Number Hard Links\n| |  |  Others Permissions     \n| |  Group Permissions  \n| Owner Permissions\nType of file: d for directory, - otherwise\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we can see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The owner, in this case, the superuser root, can read, write, and execute the file;</li>\n<li>Members of the group \"root\" can only read and execute the file;</li>\n<li>Everyone else can only read and execute the file;</li>\n<li>The file owner is \"root\";</li>\n<li>The file is owned by the group \"root\";</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Change files permissions</h2>\n<p>To change the file's permissions we can use the 'chmod' command which stands for 'change mode'. This command allows us to set the permissions (read, write, execute) of a file for the owner, group and the everyone else.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">chmod permissions filename\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can use this command in two ways the absolute mode and symbolic mode.</p>\n<h3>Absolute Mode</h3>\n<p>In this mode, file permissions are not represented as characters but as a three-digit octal number, one digit for each group. The first digit is the owner's permissions, the second is the group's permissions, and the third is the other's permissions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Number</th>\n<th>Symbol</th>\n<th>Permission</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>---</td>\n<td>No Permission</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>--x</td>\n<td>Execute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-w-</td>\n<td>Write</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-wx</td>\n<td>Execute + Write</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>r--</td>\n<td>Read</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>r-x</td>\n<td>Read + Execute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>rw-</td>\n<td>Read + Write</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>rwx</td>\n<td>Read + Write + Execute</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now imagine that you want to set the permissions of a file so that only you can read, write, and execute and the members of the group can read it. To do that you will need to run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">chmod 740 someFile\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Symbolic Mode</h3>\n<p>In this mode, you can modify permissions of a specific owner using three operators.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Operator</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>Adds a permission</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>Removes a permission</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>=</td>\n<td>Sets a permission</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Symbol</th>\n<th>Type of user</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>u</td>\n<td>user/owner</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>g</td>\n<td>group</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>o</td>\n<td>other</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>a</td>\n<td>all</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting permissions to all users</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">chmod a=rwx someFile\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding permissions to the owner</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">chmod u+x someFile\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Removing permissions to the group</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">chmod g-rw someFile\n</code></pre>"},"topicPages":[{"topic":"terminal","page":"Introduction"},{"topic":"terminal","page":"Commands"},{"topic":"terminal","page":"IO Redirection"},{"topic":"terminal","page":"Permissions"},{"topic":"terminal","page":"Process Management"},{"topic":"terminal","page":"Shortcuts"},{"topic":"terminal","page":"Customization"},{"topic":"terminal","page":"Alternatives"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
