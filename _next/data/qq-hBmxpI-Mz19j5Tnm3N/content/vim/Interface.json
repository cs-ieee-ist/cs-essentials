When you change you delete the word and vim puts you in insert mode so you can start typing and in fact change the word.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>change line</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>delete line</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Formatting text</h3>\n<p>It's sometimes helpful to format text quickly, such as paragraphs, and this can easily be done with the following command:</p>\n<p>Formatting the current paragraph</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs\">gq ap\n</code></pre>\n<p><em><strong>gq</strong></em> works based on your text width setting.</p>\n<h3>Other ways of deleting text</h3>\n<p>Now you know some ways of deleting and changing text, let's see some more ways of deleting text:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>delete the character under the cursor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>delete the character before the cursor</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You can memorize *<strong>x</strong> as exterminate. Let´s see some more useful verbs:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>dd</td>\n<td>delete the current line</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>dt.</td>\n<td>delete from where you are to the period</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>J</td>\n<td>join the current line with the next one (delete what's between)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Counts</h3>\n<p>You can also combine verbs with a count, which will perform a given action a number of times. Examples:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Combination</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>7dw</td>\n<td>delete 7 words</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>c5w</td>\n<td>change 5 words</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4dd</td>\n<td>delete the next 4 lines</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3yy</td>\n<td>yank the next 4 lines</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Note that you can use counts with almost every command, ex: 1000ctrl-a will increment the number in 1000</p>\n<h3>Modifiers</h3>\n<p>You can use modifiers to change the meaning of a noun. Some modifiers are <strong>i</strong>, which means “inner” or “inside”, and <strong>a</strong>, which means “around”.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Modifiers</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ci{</td>\n<td>change the contents inside the current pair of curly brackets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ci[</td>\n<td>change the contents inside the current pair of square brackets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ca(</td>\n<td>change a single-quoted string, including the surrounding curve brackets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>da'</td>\n<td>delete a single-quoted string, including the surrounding single quotes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Undo / Redo</h3>\n<p>Now you want to know how to undo and redo things in vim, let's see how!</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>u</td>\n<td>Undo</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ctr-r</td>\n<td>Redo</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Copy and pasting</h3>\n<h4>Copying text</h4>\n<p>The command isn't <em><strong>c</strong></em>, as one might expect. If you'll remember, <em><strong>c</strong></em> is already taken for <em><strong>change</strong></em>.\r\nVim instead uses <em><strong>y</strong></em> for <em><strong>yank</strong></em>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>y</td>\n<td>yank (copy) whatever's selected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>yy</td>\n<td>yank the current line</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Pasting text</h4>\n<p>Pasting is fairly intuitive—it uses the <em><strong>p</strong></em> verb. So, if you delete a line using dd, you can paste it back using p.</p>\n<p>One thing to remember about pasting is that it generally starts right after your cursor, and either pastes characters/words or lines or columns—based on what you copied (yanked). Also, remember that you can undo any paste with the universal undo command \"u\".</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>p</td>\n<td>paste the copied (or deleted) text after the current cursor position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>P</td>\n<td>paste the copied (or deleted) text before the current cursor position</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Repeating actions</h3>\n<p>One of the most powerful verbs in all vim is period <em><strong>.</strong></em>\r\nPeriod allows you to repeat whatever it is that you just did.</p>\n<p>Let's see an example.</p>\n<p>First, we delete a word</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs\">dw\n</code></pre>\n<p>Delete seven more words</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-markdown\"><span class=\"hljs-bullet\">7.</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another example</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs\">cw\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then you type the change the word that you want, and you can use period to make that exact change to any other word.</p>\n<p>You can use period with anything in vim!</p>\n<h2>Split Screen</h2>\n<p>Like many other editors in Vim you can split-screen horizontal or vertical.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>:vs {file name}</td>\n<td>vertical split, if there is no file name, vim will split the current screen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>:sp {file name}</td>\n<td>horizontal split, if there is no file name, vim will split the current screen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl+w h</td>\n<td>Move to the left window from current window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl+w j</td>\n<td>Move to the bottom window from current window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl+w k</td>\n<td>Move to the top window from current window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl+w l</td>\n<td>Move to the right window from current window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl+w r</td>\n<td>Swap bottom/top if split horizontally</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl+w R</td>\n<td>Swap top/bottom if split horizontally</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl+w r</td>\n<td>Rotates the windows from left to right - only if the windows are split vertically</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl+w R</td>\n<td>Rotates the windows from right to left - only if the windows are split vertically</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"topicPages":[{"topic":"vim","page":"Introduction"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Basics"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Movement"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Interface"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Reg and Macros"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Customization"},{"topic":"vim","page":"CheatSheet"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Further Reading"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
