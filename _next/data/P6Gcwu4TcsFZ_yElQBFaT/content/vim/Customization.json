This file will be located at either /etc/vim/vimrc or etc/vimrc, depending on your linux distribution.</p>\n<p>But you can create a local vimrc file, the configurations in this file will apply only to the active user account. If you don't have a local vimrc file yet, you can simply create one in your home folder. Normally the home folder is designated by ~ so you can simply create ~/.vimrc</p>\n<p>Now you have an empty .vimrc file, in the following topic, we will help you create a simple but useful vim configuration.</p>\n<h3>Basics configs - Example</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-vim\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" URL: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Example_vimrc</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Authors: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_on_Freenode</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Description: A minimal, but feature-rich, example .vimrc.

Users can use multiple split windows or multiple</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" tab pages to edit multiple files, but it is still best to enable an option to</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" allow easier switching between files.</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\"</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" One such option is the 'hidden' option, which allows you to re-use the same</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" window and switch from an unsaved buffer without saving it first. Also allows</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" you to keep an undo history for multiple files when re-using the same window</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" in this way. Note that using persistent undo also lets you undo in multiple</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" files even in the same window, but is less efficient and is actually designed</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" for keeping undo history after closing Vim entirely. Vim will complain if you</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" try to quit without saving, and swap files will keep you safe if your computer</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" crashes.</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">set</span> hidden\n \n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Note that not everyone likes working this way (with the hidden option).</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Alternatives include using tabs or split windows instead of re-using the same</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" window as mentioned above, and/or either of the following options:</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" set confirm</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" set autowriteall</span>\n \n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Better command-line completion</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">set</span> wildmenu\n \n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Show partial commands in the last line of the screen</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">set</span> showcmd\n \n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Highlight searches (use &#x3C;C-L> to temporarily turn off highlighting; see the</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" mapping of &#x3C;C-L> below)</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">set</span> hlsearch\n \n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Modelines have historically been a source of security vulnerabilities.

By default, your Vim settings are contained in ~/.vim, so that's where Vim looks for plugins when you launch it.</p>\n<p>When you start Vim, it first processes your .vimrc file, and then it scans all directories in ~/.vim for plugins contained in pack/*/start.</p>\n<p>By default, your ~/.vim directory (if you even have one) has no such file structure, so set that up with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">$</span><span class=\"bash\"> mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start</span></code></pre>\n<p>For example, try installing <a href=\"https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree\">NERDTree</a>, a text-based file manager for Vim. First, use Git to clone a snapshot of the NERDTree repository:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">$</span><span class=\"bash\"> git <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">clone</span> https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree.git ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/nerdtree</span>\nvim -u NONE -c \"helptags ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/nerdtree/doc\" -c q</code></pre>\n<p>Launch Vim, and type this command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-vim\">:NERDTree</code></pre>\n<h4>Some Usefull Plugins</h4>\n<p>Here are some Vim plugins that may be useful:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree\">NERDTree</a> is a file system explorer for the Vim editor.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter\">gitgutter</a> is a Vim plugin that shows a git diff in the sign column. It shows which lines have been added, modified, or removed.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vim-scripts/taglist.vim\">TagList</a> is a source code browser plugin for Vim and provides an overview of the structure of the source code files and allows you to efficiently browse through source code files for different programming languages.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim\">Lightline</a> a light and configurable statusline/tabline plugin for Vim.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs\">Auto-Pairs</a> insert or delete brackets, parens, quotes in pairs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim\">ack</a> run your favorite search tool from Vim, with an enhanced results list.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Plugin Manager</h3>\n<h4>Do I really need a plugin manager?</h4>\n<p>No. Plugin managers have always been and will always be optional.</p>\n<h4>What is the benefits of using a plugin manager?</h4>\n<p>A plugin manager may be useful if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you use too many plugins,</li>\n<li>you like to try new plugins,</li>\n<li>you absolutely want your plugins to be always up-to-date.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you use too many plugins, the usual installation scheme will likely become too messy very quickly.\nPlugin managers usually keep track of what is installed and where in order to make the whole thing easier for the user.</p>\n<p>If you like to try new plugins, plugin managers usually make it easier to install/remove individual plugins.</p>\n<p>If you absolutely want your plugins to be always up-to-date, plugin managers usually give you commands for updating or even auto-updating individual plugins.</p>\n<h4>Some Plugins Managers</h4>\n<p>There are several plugin managers, a plugin manager is the cleanest way to install plugins in vim, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\">Pathogen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim\">Vundle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">VimPlug</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim\">NeoBundle</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Do 90% of What Plugins Do With Just Vim?</h2>\n<p>This section will be heavily inspired on a lecture sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA2WjJbmmoM&#x26;vl=en\">thoughtbot</a>. In this sub-topic we will talk about fuzzy file search, tag jumping and autocomplete, if you want to see file browsing and snippets, you might consider watching the lecture.</p>\n<p>Note that this section is not to discourage you to use plugins, the objective of this section is to show you that vim is a lot powerful.</p>\n<h3>Fuzzy File Search</h3>\n<p>If you want a fuzzy file search vim has git your back without a plugin!</p>\n<p>Add this to you .vimrc file</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-vim\">path +=**</code></pre>\n<p>This will allow vim so search for files in sub-directories and so on of a root directory.</p>\n<p>With this trick, you do not need a Fuzzy File Search in Vim, because now your vim is capable of accessing a file deep in a file tree.\nLet's consider the following directory tree</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">topics\n|\n|-- bash\n|   |- introdution1.md\n|   |- permissions.md\n|\n|-- vim\n|   |- introdution2.md\n|   |- movement.md\n|\n|-- git\n|   |- introdution3.md\n|   |- blobs\n|   |   |- firstBlob.md\n|   |   |- secontBlob.md\n|   |   |- cBlob.c</code></pre>\n<p>For this, to work you have to start vim in the root directory (topics).\nNow you want to work in vim's movement.md file, you just type in vim the command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-vim\">:<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">find</span> movement.md</code></pre>\n<p>You can also tab so vim will know what file you are talking about and complete.</p>\n<p>If you tab and there is more than one match vim will present you with the various matches and you choose</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-vim\">:<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">find</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">intro</span></code></pre>\n<p>and then you tab, vim will present you the three possibilities introdution1.md, introdution2.md, introdution3.md. You can navigate in the choices that vims gives you with tabs.</p>\n<p>Back to our example, so we use <strong>:find movement.md</strong> and we are in /topics/vim/movement.md, now we want to work on secondBlob.md, but that file is in another directory it is in /topics/git/blobs/secondBlob.md, we can!!! That is why we started vim in the root directory topics. You just need to do </p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-vim\">:<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">find</span> secontBlob.md</code></pre>\n<p>This is a lot more powerful, like a normal fuzzy finder you can search using file types</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-vim\">:<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">find</span> *.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">c</span></code></pre>\n<p>It will open the cBlob.c</p>\n<h3>Tag jumping</h3>\n<p>You can use Tags, and jump between Tags without using a plugin, here's how!</p>\n<p>Using tags makes it easier to jump to certain parts of your programs. First run ctags from the UNIX command line on your source files ( to generate a <strong><em>tags</em></strong> file, then use these while editing your source files:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tags Command</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>:tag TAB</td>\n<td>list the known tags</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>:tag function_name</td>\n<td>jump to that function</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl-t</td>\n<td>goes to the previous spot where you called :tag</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl-]</td>\n<td>calls :tag on the word under the cursor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>:ptag</td>\n<td>open tag in preview window (also ctrl-w })</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>:pclose</td>\n<td>close preview window</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Autocomplete</h3>\n<p>You have several auto-complete plugins such as AouCompleteMe.\nBut Vim has Autocomplete built-in if you just hit Ctrl + n while in insert mode, and you'll get a list of word suggestions.\nTo make the list cycle backward, hit Ctrl + p. You can also use the arrow keys to move up and down the list.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Autocomplete Keys</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl-x + ctrl-n</td>\n<td>for just this file</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl-x + ctrl-f</td>\n<td>for filenames (works with our path trick!)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl-x + ctrl-J</td>\n<td>for tags only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl-n</td>\n<td>for anything specified by the 'complete' option and next on the list</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ctrl-p</td>\n<td>previous on the list</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n"},"topicPages":[{"topic":"vim","page":"Introduction"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Basics"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Movement"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Interface"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Reg and Macros"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Customization"},{"topic":"vim","page":"CheatSheet"},{"topic":"vim","page":"Further Reading"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
